# **App Name**: Course Compass

## Core Features:

- Course Listing: Display a welcome message and a list of available courses on the homepage.
- Course Page Display: Display the course title, description, table of contents, and individual sections on a dedicated course page. Implement collapsible sections for better readability.
- PDF Export: Provide a 'Download PDF' button on each course page.  Use a client-side library to generate and download a PDF version of the course content, rendered directly from the markdown already present in the Firestore document.
- Motivational Quote: Display a quote or motivational study message at the top of each course page, fetched directly from a premade list in the Nextjs code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to give an academic and soft feel.
- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA), very desaturated and bright, to give a clean and minimalist appearance.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#ADD8E6) to add a touch of calmness without being distracting.
- Body font: 'Literata', a serif font providing a classic academic feel for readability. Headline font: 'Literata', for headlines and body text.
- Use a clean, single-column layout for course pages to enhance focus. Employ collapsible sections or accordions for course notes to avoid overwhelming the user.
- In the collapsible accordions, use minimal and professional iconography.
